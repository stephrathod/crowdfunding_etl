This project is centered around ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load), which is a series of skills that allow one to clean, simplify, and update large sums of data. 
Large data sets can be unorganized and may contain certain values that distract from what the data is truly representing, and must be "cleaned".
Data can "cleaned" by removing unnecessary columns in which we are extracting those with meaningful use.
Often times we are comparing a variety of subjects, and may need to merge multiple dataframes to get a clear representation of what we are studying. In this instance, we are transforming the data.
After we have extracted and transformed all necessary components of the data frame, we need to upload that information into a new file.
Data Sources can be found in the "Resources" folder labeled "contacts.xlxs" and "crowdfunding.xlxs".
